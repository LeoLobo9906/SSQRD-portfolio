SSQRD is a discovery/e-commerce platform for independent and sustainable fashion/beauty brands.  
This repository showcases my contributions to the product’s front end, design system, and API integrations.

## Highlights (What I shipped)
- Built responsive pages and components in **HTML/CSS/JS + Flask/Jinja** with a modern, minimal aesthetic.
- Integrated **Supabase** + **Firebase** APIs for auth, profiles, and watchlists; wired search with **Typesense**.
- Implemented UI motion (scroll-triggered fades, typewriter/fade cascades) and micro-interactions.
- Drove accessibility/performance improvements (lazy loading, semantic landmarks, ARIA labels).
- Collaborated directly with founders/design to translate Figma mockups into production UI.

## Tech Stack

**Backend templating:** Flask (Python), Jinja  
**Data & Services:** Supabase, Firebase Auth, Typesense (search)

## Selected Implementations
- **Responsive Navigation & Layouts:** Mobile-first grid, sticky nav, glassmorphism footer, animated hero sections.
- **Filters & Search UX:** Brand/subcategory filters, price slider, live filtering hooked to Typesense.

## My Process
1. Translate Figma mockups → modular components.
2. Connect components to APIs (Supabase/Firebase/Typesense).
3. Add motion/accessibility; test cross-browser.
4. Open PRs, request design/QA review, and iterate.

## Notes
- This repo does **not** contain source code; it documents my work for recruiters and collaborators.
- I’m happy to walk through specific flows (navigation, filters, watchlist) in an interview.
